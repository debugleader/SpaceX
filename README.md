# SpaceX

This is a **web application** that consumes the [SpaceX API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API), and turns it into a [GraphQL](https://github.com/graphql) API using [express-graphql](https://github.com/graphql/express-graphql), then it's consumed by [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) using [Apollo](https://github.com/apollographql) as a client!

* Host it on your own machine.

```
Clone, switch to the Heroku branch and cd into the repository location in your machine.
```
```bash
npm install
```
```bash
npm run server
```
> Warning: There is a chance that one day, the API might have changes which could break the web app. Please, if you're facing any issues, [contact me](mailto:alkhassakyabdallah@gmail.com).

> This application was initially built by Brad Traversy in this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEMTj8w04Z8), I simply improved the application and added some styling, and more functionalities.
